Work follows [tasks/README.md](tasks/README.md): pick the lowest-numbered ready
or in-progress task. Use Zig 0.17.0, `deno task test:compiler` and
`deno task lint:zig` before each compiler commit.

## State on 9 October 2026

- Task 010 (variable-indexed solver worklists) is complete: `352b3ff`, closed in
  `6a4271c`.
- Task 002 (packed List F32 fold regression) is in progress. The latest commit
  hoists the crossing-row buffer and assembles two-leaf rows with two
  constant-size copies. F32 folds are now within 0.6–1.7% of boxed at widths
  14–16 and at or below 1.006 elsewhere; the all-width gate stays open.
- Task 004 (general principal/residual call summaries) is in progress; see its
  task file for rejected experiments.

## Next steps for task 002

1. Run the gdev compile comparison for the latest commit, allowing the intended
   Wasm difference:
   `deno task bench:compile --baseline build/bench/indexed-solver-lazy-release/blotc --candidate build/bench/list-two-block-crossing/blotc --runs 7 --workload gdev --allow-wasm-diff`.
2. Repeat the F32 record/tuple batches on a quieter host
   (`scripts/bench_list_traversal.ts BOXED NEW std OUT record|tuple 16 f32`,
   boxed compiler `build/compiler-hills/final/blotc`). If widths 14–16 stay
   above 1.0, investigate the remaining per-crossing cost (tree walk and the two
   64-byte copies feeding 4-byte loads).
3. Analysis tools from this session live in `build/bench/f32-fold-analysis/`:
   `multi.ts` (hand-edited Wasm comparisons), `dump_seq.py` (TurboFan
   register-allocated sequences; trace with
   `--v8-flags=--trace-turbo,--trace-turbo-path=.,--trace-turbo-filter=wasm-function#N`
   and call the function before exiting).

## Notes

- Compare allocation release-to-release: debug `blotc` reports roughly 10% less
  requested allocation than release.
- `../zig-analyzer` currently has an uncommitted `double-release` rule that
  flags guarded `defer if (alive)` patterns (10 false positives). The CI pin
  `756bfd5` reports zero findings; run with
  `ZIG_ANALYZER=/tmp/blot-qualified-analyzer-756bfd5/zig-out/bin/zig-analyzer`.
- Corpus differential and budget scripts:
  `build/bench/indexed-solver-lazy-release/tools/`.
