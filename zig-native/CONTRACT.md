# Native compiler implementation contract

This directory is a handwritten Zig 0.17 compiler. `grammar.baba`,
`compiler/guide.md`, executable behavior tests and `std/` are the source of
language behavior. Frozen reference fixtures are test data, not runtime
dependencies. No generated semantic functions or boxed `Value` runtime may be
imported into this compiler.

## Storage and ownership

Source bytes are immutable UTF-8. Tokens refer to byte ranges. Identifiers use
`symbols.Symbol = u32`; zero is absent. `symbols.Pool` owns one byte buffer with
offset/length entries and stable numeric IDs. Hashes locate candidates; exact
bytes decide identity. Array growth must never invalidate hash keys or handles.
AST IDs, type IDs and instruction IDs are 32-bit indexes into contiguous owned
tables. Lists are spans in side arrays. There are no per-character nodes,
semantic linked lists or persistent tree maps in hot mutable state.

Individual compilations use owned arrays and explicit deinitialization, not an
unbounded arena of obsolete inference versions. Published syntax/typed bodies
are immutable. Scratch state is released before final output publication.
Historical solver semantics use dense version records and explicit cursors;
ordinary union-find is not an assumed substitute for the reference behavior.

## Frontend interface

`token.zig`: `Tag`, `Token { tag, start: u32, end: u32 }`. `lexer.zig`:
`lex(allocator, source) !Result`, where Result owns a flat token array and
diagnostics; `deinit(allocator)` releases it. Preserve comments, numeric/Unicode
errors and layout behavior from source preprocessing.

`ast.zig`: `Id = u32`, absent ID zero; `Span { start: u32, end: u32 }`; `Tag`
with semantic syntax roles; compact `Node { tag, a, b, c }` and separate source
spans. `Tree` owns node/span/extra/root arrays and diagnostics. An extras list
is always `(start, len)`, never a head/tail. `Tree.node(id)` and `Tree.span(id)`
read immutable entries. Names are numeric symbols. Literal numbers carry exact
U32 or binary32 bits.

`parser.zig`: `parse(allocator, source, tokens, symbols) !ast.Tree`. Full
surface syntax is separate from semantic admission. Preserve import/declaration
order, fixity and written evaluation order. Grammar keywords `froM`/`wherE` are
private frontend markers; source accepts contextual `from`/`where` without
reserving them everywhere.

Document exact node fields in ast.zig before checker/backend consumers use them.
Lambda fields must expose parameter, annotations, and body. Declaration fields
must expose name, annotations, body and export modifier. No consumer should
recover semantic structure by reparsing source.

## Semantic and backend boundaries

`types.zig`: an owned compact type table and chronological constraints with
occurs checks, rollback and cursor-relative resolution. Invalid inference is a
diagnostic; unsupported features must explicitly decline. Frozen principal
schemes belong to declarations, instantiated evidence belongs to uses.

`check.zig`: `check(allocator, tree, symbols) !Checked`; Checked owns expression
types, resolved local/global identities and diagnostics. Validate unused source
declarations too. Report unsupported semantic features explicitly; no silent
fallback or pretending an unsupported construct is valid.

The CLI, native checks and executed-Wasm tests are the production gates.
Validate all declarations, including unused ones. Keep effects, staging, guest
ABI and fresh-versus-retained output checks intact during performance changes.
