# Continue the owned-storage rewrite

## Current frontier

Compilation latency is the active priority: **subsecond Gdev compilation**. Do
not repeat the recorded 36-minute main build. The diagnostic runner defaults to
a five-second build deadline and kills the compiler on timeout.

The first batch shares nested scalar definitions and memoizes pure direct-call
admission with exact source-owned zero-row certificates. Five alternating
Safe/noLLVM pairs on the depth-12 graph improve median build time from **676.75
ms to 88.53 ms**, expressions from **131,106 to 661**, and Wasm from **952,207
to 7,529 bytes**.
[Pinned evidence](zig-native/measurements/scoped-call-sharing-2026-10-31.json)
keeps this synthetic result separate from Gdev: its original language fixture
remains about 480 ms; actor presentation and main exceed the five-second cutoff.
The whole-game target remains open. Next measure real admission declines and
substitution/captured-environment work before extending sharing to aggregates
and descriptor-bearing helpers.

This is a greenfield project. Breaking changes are welcome; remove superseded
APIs and implementations. Preserve useful behavior, assertions, deterministic
math, original workloads and independent references. Read `AGENTS.md`,
`compiler/guide.md`, `zig-native/CONTRACT.md` and `tasks/STORAGE_REWRITE.md`.

Actual Gdev main passed one headless native Pen frame on the last
frame-qualified compiler `52e04df6` and matching host. All six checks pass. The
inspected 640×480 startup image and guest trace match the original frame byte
for byte.

reuse
[the identical existing PNG](tasks/storage-handoff-evidence/2026-10-31-first-frame.png).
The earlier e6 compiler's
[first-frame record](tasks/storage-handoff-evidence/2026-10-31-first-frame.json)
remains historical evidence. Broader gameplay, browser, recovery and release
qualification remain open.

The active source/API migration covers the full Ink/Gdev inventories, fixtures,
generators and active documentation. Current language uses `func`, explicit
`return`, curried `->`, `$Constructor`, primitive booleans, `and`/`or` and
`#[...]` arrays. Grammar-rejection fixtures, foreign shader syntax and
historical captures intentionally retain their own text. Generated sources must
come from generator inputs, never manual output patches.

## Checked compiler fixes

The last frame-qualified compiler is the reviewed contract-method candidate, SHA
`52e04df6262c1572f07e9f16d474019a77dbdfbfd5fc1c042ea8fa3cb3242004`. Older exact
candidates may be absent locally; portable evidence qualifies its named
candidate rather than every later revision.

- [Imported opaque layouts](tasks/storage-handoff-evidence/2026-10-31-opaque-layouts.json)
  use exact closed producer metadata while preserving public opacity.
- Loop refinements, literal SIMD forwarding, proven-empty nested rows and
  impossible pattern fallbacks have executed regression coverage in the linked
  records under `tasks/storage-handoff-evidence/`. Original hauling and full
  packet fixtures now run without dummy rows or altered algorithms.
- [Lexical schemes](tasks/storage-handoff-evidence/2026-10-31-lexical-schemes.json)
  use bounded immutable lists, avoiding sparse temporary-fact saturation.
- [Indexed mutation](tasks/storage-handoff-evidence/2026-10-31-indexed-fields.json)
  preserves original owner and selected-field equations, including two indices.
- [Callback values](tasks/storage-handoff-evidence/2026-10-31-callback-values.json)
  align source/Core recipe classification while keeping invocation and no-store
  checks strict. All six original Gdev restore tests and both rejection tests
  pass. The latest native inventory compiles 2,730 tests; 435/436 affected laws
  pass with the same independently reproduced associated-partial baseline
  failure. All 61 affected guest tests pass.

[Contract methods](tasks/storage-handoff-evidence/2026-10-31-contract-methods.json)
now select exact visible implementations with full signature/effect evidence and
context-sensitive reusable calls. Original Gdev language tests and Ink
custom-codec persistence, including all 260 truncated inputs, pass on the final
candidate. Actual main now passes the recorded native frame on this binary.

Astra xhigh reviewed the semantic fixes and performance batch. Earlier gate
attempts on the frame candidate were blocked fetching locked Baba 9.0.1. This
host reaches protocol smoke: three pass and one fails on existing operand-span
ends, independently reproduced with the preserved baseline compiler. Full
qualification remains pending. The performance batch compiles all 2,733 native
tests; its affected family passes 103/104 laws with the recorded
associated-partial baseline failure, plus six additional native laws. All three
new laws pass, including exhaustive publication allocation failures. Affected
guests pass 38/39 with the independently reproduced associated-latent baseline.
Full Zig lint now reports zero findings across 565 source files.

## Remaining execution work

Source checks are distinct from emitting original exports and running
assertions. The `52e04df6` Ink inventory passes all 325 files: 322 valid files
and three intended semantic rejections, with matching end-of-run source digest.
Gdev's `52e04df6` inventory also passes all 441 current files:438 valid files
and three intended rejections. Both complete audits have matching end-of-run
source digests. Exact records and reproduction commands are in
[the migration evidence](tasks/storage-handoff-evidence/2026-10-31-source-migration.json).

All 68 original prepared-physics comparisons now pass on `9902355f`, including
all three modes at2,048 fixed bodies, with named source/proxy owners and
unchanged limits. All nine adapter entries pass 71 cases per mode. On
`52e04df6`, all six Gdev language/Format entries, six restore entries, both
restore traps and actor presentation's66 checks pass. The parser's typed leaves
execute, while its complete original module reaches the checked layout budget.
Full affordance, salt-clicks and remaining original-export qualification stay
open. Preserve original workloads and assertions while resolving those gaps.

Ordinary legacy backend retirement is still unfinished (task 120). Some pure
programs still emit ABI 3; do not fake ABI 8 with unused owners or claim that
the whole rewrite is complete. Task 121 covers final behavior and measurements.
Release/performance claims require the qualified release compiler.

## Integration and checks

Use the existing sibling checkouts. Build with Zig 0.17.0, checking
`zig version` first, and `-Dllvm=false` for development/native tests. Use
coherent affected batches and the required full gate as documented in
`AGENTS.md`.

Run actual Gdev main through native Pen, including its real imports and assets:

```sh
python3 scripts/storage_handoff/run_pen.py --launch
```

The default command recompiles every run. To retry rendering an already checked
actual main, use its exact artifact hash (the current record above identifies
this build):

```sh
python3 scripts/storage_handoff/run_pen.py --launch --compiled-main ../gdev/.pen/runtime/game.wasm --expected-wasm-sha256 63a4ae23b2ff61198b0d02ad47c2cd1342a524f33f16becc0a193ec2374fef0c
```

This copies the unchanged Wasm and starting scene into a fresh bundle, retaining
the original assets/text/locales/presets and all six host checks. It uses Pen's
standard raw-Wasm loader. Explicit Vulkan driver settings are respected; the
runner can also find the optional onboarding Mesa sysroot. No source compilation
or optimization runs in this mode. Rebuild after semantic changes rather than
reusing an older artifact.

Require every runner check and inspect the PNG. For a compile-only diagnosis:

```sh
deno run --no-config --no-lock -A scripts/storage_handoff/build_gdev.ts --compiler zig-native/zig-out-dev/bin/blotc --timeout-ms 5000 > /tmp/gdev-main.log 2>&1
python3 scripts/storage_handoff/report.py /tmp/gdev-main.log
```

Use `--entry tests/language_compatibility.blot` for the small real fixture and
`--profile` for completed-build phase attribution. The diagnostic accepts at
most 30 seconds; a timeout remains incomplete. Defer the Pen frame driver's
regular application pipeline until bounded compilation is fast enough. The older
PNG does not qualify a later compiler.

The reusable frontend inventory checks unused declarations through overlays:

```sh
deno run --no-config --no-lock -A scripts/migration_audit.ts --project ../gdev --expectations ../gdev/tests/migration_expectations.json --report /tmp/gdev-audit.json
```

It does not emit original exports or execute their assertions. Its project
source digest excludes external library snapshots; rerun after dependencies
settle. Keep large outputs ignored and commit concise portable evidence.

## Frozen contracts

- ABI 8, session 2, Gdev saved framing 26 and packet order remain fixed.
- Gdev storage: 2 MiB temporary, 256 KiB persistent, 2 MiB transport, 4,096
  owners. Reply budget: 64 MiB including assets.
- Production expansion: 500,000 expressions per physical function; layout work:
  100,000. Engine bounds: 7,654,321 body bytes, 50,000 parameters/locals and
  1,000,000 globals. Do not raise these limits to pass fixtures.
- Named owners are independent. Access records alias live pools. Borrowed views
  remain invocation-local; copy retained history and host/worker packets.
  Preserve callback effects and explicit checkpoint/restore. Renderer rejection
  is not rollback. Language tasks are retired; copied-packet workers remain.
- Gdev FrameAccess has 165 fields and four explicitly pure storage callbacks.
  Preserve exact generic field types and real latent callback effects.

Continuously commit coherent checked batches to each `main` and verify remote
hashes. Preserve unrelated work. Environment publication requires a separate
explicit request. Older checkpoint narratives remain in pinned Git history and
portable evidence, rather than duplicate continuation documents.
